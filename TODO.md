Add headers to every single chunk created
MAC autoexec header
Geo Exporter
UV Exporter
Get WinXP VM working to test things in

Questions:
Are offsets cumulative (is the offset for chunk X its distance from the last chunk's start, or the file's start?)
Does a .cpj file need to include every chunk type, or can some simply be blank?
